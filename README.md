### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to see you here ðŸ‘¾

My name is Valeria and have been coding professionally for more than 3 years now. Most of my skills are self-taught and honed with feedback from my colleagues over the years.
I am constantly on a mission to improve my skills and get a better understanding of coding concepts, rather than focusing on the next big trend.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [TheSewingStore](https://github.com/valeriafurin/TheSewingStore) where I am trying to get better at understanding architecture of Web App with a databse..
- ðŸŒ± I am also interested in Mobile and Fullstack Developement, all while keeping the Clean Code principals in mind ðŸŒ±
