### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to see you here ðŸ‘¾

My name is Valeria and have been coding professionally for almost 3 years now. Most of my skills are self-taught and honed with feedback from my colleagues over the years.
I am constantly on a mission to improve my skills and get a better understanding of coding concepts, rather than focusing on the next big trend.

Below you will find a little sneak peak of some of my work - 
Iâ€™m currently working on the PatternShopProject where I am trying to get a better grasp of React Server Components, Next and GraphQL.
I am also interested in Mobile and Fullstack Developement, all while keeping the Clean Code principals in mind ðŸŒ±
